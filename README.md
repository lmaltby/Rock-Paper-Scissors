# Rock-Paper-Scissors

#This is a console-based game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, as part of my learning through The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. This game is played through a loop five times, so you'll need to win best of five to be victorious. 

#If you are a friend that I sent this to for validation, it's important to know that you need to open the developer tools with ***Control, Shift, I*** to view the console. However, I recommend you play it through once without peeking at the console, it's a little more fun that way. The console will let you see what the computer chooses, and will tell you if you won a round or not. Otherwise, all you'll see is the prompt for your answer and then a lot of suspense, followed by a popup with your win/loss/tie. 

#If you are wondering why you don't see the computer's choice and your own nicely juxtaposed on the screen: that's supposedly what we do in part 2 of the project later on. Just go on a journey of self-discovery or something in the meantime, it'll be here when you get back. 

#If you look at the code, you'll probably notice that I used far too many "if, else if, else" statements to determine the result of a matchup. You see, dear reader, I have not learned how to use switch cases yet, and so it was only suggested to try switch cases after I had finally gotten that part to work. Therefore, like any responsible programmer, I dared not disturb that code which is not yet broken (at least not until later, when this project is supposed to circle back around and we add a browser GUI and make it look all nice and pretty). 
Also, I was just happy it finally worked after I had accidentally passed the parameters backwards the first time, and couldn't figure out why it was telling me that losses were wins, and vice versa.
